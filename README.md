1. Finish the show route for /symptoms/:id. Display all diseases associated with that symptom.

What I did:
	1.	On the symptoms.js controller, I added the route handler for GET /symptoms/:id to find the one symptom and all of its diseases.
			The router responds by rendering a symptoms/show.ejs page to send to the user.
	2.	I created a symptoms/show.ejs rendering page, which shows the symptom and information on all of its related diseases.
	3.	I then tested and debugged my application to work correctly.
	4.	I confirmed that I completed the work on the show route as requested.

2. Add at least two more images.

What I did:
	1.	I found and added an image to the diseases/all.ejs page.
	2.	I found and added an image to the symptoms/all.ejs page.
	3.	I tested my work to verify that the images showed correctly.

3.	Visit the bootstrap cheatsheet and discover at least 2 new styles from it:

What I did:
	1.	I visited the bootstrap cheatsheet that Reno provided.
	2.	I could not find the classes I was looking for, the ones you used...
	3.	I added two classes to my work that I could find on the cheatsheet, btn-lg and btn-sm.
